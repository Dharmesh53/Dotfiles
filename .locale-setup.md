To change your system locale from en_IN (Indian English) to en_US (US English), follow these steps:

1. Verify Available Locales

List the available locales on your system:

locale -a

Ensure en_US.UTF-8 is in the list. If itâ€™s not available, you need to generate it.

2. Generate the en_US.UTF-8 Locale

Edit the /etc/locale.gen file to enable the desired locale:

sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

Find the line for en_US.UTF-8 and uncomment it (remove the # at the beginning):

en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8

Then generate the locale:

sudo locale-gen

3. Set en_US.UTF-8 as the Default Locale

Set the system-wide locale by editing or creating the /etc/locale.conf file:

sudo nano /etc/locale.conf

Add or update the following line:

LANG=en_US.UTF-8

4. Update Locale for the Current Session

To apply the locale for the current terminal session, run:

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

5. Optional: Update Environment Settings

If your environment sets the locale elsewhere (like .bashrc, .zshrc, or /etc/environment), update those files.

For example, in .bashrc:

nano ~/.bashrc

Add or replace:

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

6. Reboot or Restart Services

Reboot the system or restart relevant services to apply the changes:

sudo reboot

Alternatively, restart the shell or reload the configuration:

source ~/.bashrc

7. Verify the New Locale

Confirm the new locale settings by running:

locale

You should see en_US.UTF-8 as the active locale.

Let me know if you encounter any issues!
